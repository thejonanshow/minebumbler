# Minebumbler

A lovely little text game bearing a slight resemblance to some other games that
may or may not have existed but was definitely not influenced by any of them to
the point that it infringes on any copyrights.

## Installation

Install the game:

    $ gem install minebumbler

## Usage

    # The -d flag sets the difficulty, 1-10
    $ minebumbler -d 1

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
